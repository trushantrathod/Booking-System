Future Enhancements

There are several features we could add to make this booking system more robust and user-friendly:

1. Data Persistence with Firebase Firestore:

Currently, bookings are static. Using Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database, we could store bookings on a server and retrieve them based on user-specific data, making the bookings persistent and accessible across different sessions.

2. Enhanced Calendar Features:

Implement recurring bookings for repeated events.
Add color coding for different types of events or priorities.
Enable time-slot blocking to prevent double-booking.

3. Email Notifications:

Set up automated emails to remind users of upcoming bookings or to confirm new bookings using a service like Firebase Functions with SendGrid.

4. Improved UI and UX:

Add a more polished design using a library like Material-UI or Bootstrap.
Implement a responsive layout for mobile users.

5. Authorization and Access Control:

Add role-based access control, allowing admins to view all users' bookings while regular users can only view their own.

6. Deployment and Hosting:

Deploy the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy the backend on a service like Heroku, Firebase Functions, or AWS.
